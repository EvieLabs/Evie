# Reacord

Reacord is a framework to create interactive Discord messages using React.
It's originally by itsMapleLeaf and is found [here](https://github.com/itsMapleLeaf/reacord).

I decided to make a fork of it as when I discovered it didn't work out the box thanks to ESM problems and outdated type definitions.
