# Reacord

Reacord is a framework to create interactive Discord messages using React.
It's originally by itsMapleLeaf and is found [here](https://github.com/itsMapleLeaf/reacord).

I decided to make a fork of it when I discovered it didn't work out the box due to ESM problems and outdated type definitions.
Reacord is also a fairly new library and if I find any bugs I can quickly fix them and create new features.
